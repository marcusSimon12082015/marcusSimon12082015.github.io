So here we are. I have completed my last project and I am already thinking of ways to implement new features, refactor already existing code or just redo some stuff from scratch. 

My first task that I intend to complete is the search bar I have already implemented in my Rails project that allows the user to search comics by different criteria; allows users to create multiple lists based on their favorite characters, users following other users and subscribing to their reviews and comments. 

I will certainly try to learn as much as I can about React and Redux before I start my job hunt. I have already tried a few challenges on HackerRank and I am planning to read and re-read Cracking the Coding Interview, do some courses on Udemy.


I will start new projects as I want to avoid tutorial hell and I am already looking for new exciting ideas.
So never stop learning.
